            During my internship at Rackron Technologies, I worked on real-world web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I contributed to both frontend and backend development, implemented RESTful APIs, and helped design dynamic user interfaces. This experience enhanced my understanding of full-stack development, version control (Git), and collaborative teamwork in an Agile environment.
